# ressolver
Solver of resistance composition in parallel

Typical output:
```Using  E12  series of resistance values in parallel to make 195.43Ω  within:  5 % precision,
    combine 390Ω  with 390Ω  giving  195.00Ω,  within 0.2%  precision
    combine 330Ω  with 470Ω  giving  193.88Ω,  within 0.8%  precision
    combine 270Ω  with 680Ω  giving  193.26Ω,  within 1.1%  precision
    combine 270Ω  with 820Ω  giving  203.12Ω,  within 3.9%  precision
